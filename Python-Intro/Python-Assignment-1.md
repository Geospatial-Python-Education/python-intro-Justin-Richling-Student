Welcome to the Python Intro Assignment!

---

This will hopefully be a nice guide into understanding what is ```syntax``` and what Python's specific syntax is.

Synatx (rough) definition:

> Every spoken language has a general set of rules for how words and sentences should be structured. These rules are collectively known as the language syntax. In computer programming, syntax serves the same purpose, defining how declarations, functions, commands, and other statements should be arranged.

> Many computer programming languages share similar syntax rules, while others have a unique syntax design. For example, C and Java use a similar syntax, while Perl has many characteristics that are not seen in either the C or Java languages.

> A program's source code must have correct syntax in order to compile correctly and be made into a program. In fact, it must have perfect syntax, or the program will fail to compile and produce a "syntax error." A syntax error can be as simple as a missing parenthesis or a forgotten semicolon at the end of a statement. Even these small errors will keep the source code from compiling.

> Fortunately, most integrated development environments (IDEs) include a parser, which detects syntax errors within the source code. Modern parsers can even highlight syntax errors before a program is compiled, making it easy for the programmer to locate and fix them.

In addition, you will learn some basics about data types and how to work in the Jupyter Notebook framework.

Jupyter is a great working notebook for Python code that let's the user run full code blocks or individual pieces for an easy way to understand exactly what is happening in your code. Many Python IDE's (integrated development environment) can also allow for this type of ```debugging``` but Jupyter is a much more visual and simple framework compared to the IDE.

Python is a a very flexible language to work with and the basis of its workflow is to allow for external packages or libraries to be imported. There are a growing number of 3rd party packages that can be downloaded, but one of the major downsides to Python is that packages can butt heads with each other in relation to their underlying dependencies.

Thus, the fantastic team at Anaconda have created a ```package manager``` called Conda!

* https://docs.anaconda.com/

The main purpose of this manger is to chack dependencies of all underlying packages for each new install to comabt the dependency conflicts that typically arise when installing packages on your own.

To begin our journey into Python, we will download and install the Conda Package Manager. This site will give some reading material as well as the location to download the application:

* https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/

The Anaconda Navigator is a multi-application application(!) that will download several good applications besides Jupyter as well as the option to download and install more, such as R Studio, Visual Studio Code, etc. One of the other default applications it installs is the Spyder IDE, so if you find you don't like the Jupyter framework, you can work in a more standard environment of the IDE.

The goal of this class is to get you (somewhat) comfortable with Python and to get you some skills in working with geospatial datasets since your career fields all use some kind of data from models or observations.

## Things to accomplish in this assignment:

<ul>
  
  <li>Download and install Anaconda Navigator!</li>
  
  <li>Explore the navigator and open a Jupyter Notebook
    <ul>
      <li>Print the statement "Hello World!"</li>
      <li>Assign variables: ```a = 5``` and ```b = 15``` and print out the addition of ```a``` and ```b```</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
</ul>

<dl>
  <dt>First Term</dt>
  <dd>This is the definition of the first term.</dd>
  <dt>Second ```Term```</dt>
  <dd>This is one definition of the second term. </dd>
  <dd>This is another definition of the second term.</dd>
