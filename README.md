Welcome to the Python Intro Assignment!

---

This will hopefully be a nice guide into understanding what is ```syntax``` and what Python's specific syntax is.

In addition, you will learn some basics about data types and how to work in the Jupyter Notebook framework.

Jupyter is a great working notebook for Python code that let's the user run full code blocks or individual pieces for an easy way to understand exactly what is happening in your code. Many Python IDE's (integrated development environment) can also allow for this type of ```debugging``` but Jupyter is a much more visual and simple framework compared to the IDE.

Python is a a very flexible language to work with and the basis of its workflow is to allow for external packages or libraries to be imported. There are a growing number of 3rd party packages that can be downloaded, but one of the major downsides to Python is that packages can butt heads with each other in relation to their underlying packages. 

Thus, the fantastic team at Anaconda have created a ```p[ackage manager``` called Conda! The main purpose of this manger is to chack dependencies of all underlying packages for each new install to comabt the dependency conflicts that typically arise when installing packages on your own.

To begin our journey into Python, we will download and install the Conda Package Manager. This site will give some reading material as well as the location to download the application:

The Anaconda Navigator is a multi-application application(!) that will download several good applications besides Jupyter as well as the option to download and install more, such as R Studio, Visual Studio Code, etc. One of the other default applications it installs is the Spyder IDE, so if you find you don't like the Jupyter framework, you can work in a more standard environment of the IDE.
