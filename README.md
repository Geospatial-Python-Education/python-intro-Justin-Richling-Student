Welcome to the Python Geospatial Classroom!

---

The goal of this class is to get you (somewhat) comfortable with Python and to get you some skills in working with geospatial datasets since your career fields all use some kind of data from models or observations.

---

There will be assignments that you will complete and upload all via GitHub. This is going to be weird and non-intuiative at first, but if you plan on using code in your career at any point, especially as a member of collaboration, this will come in very handy.
